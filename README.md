# Final project for CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science
## Ekrador's Game
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/VFWq6UDF190
#### Description:
This is an isometric role-playing game built in the Love 2D engine using Lua.   
Here the player can improve the characteristics and skills of his character,  
obtain items and gain experience by defeating monsters.  
On the map we have a merchant who trade undefined items and potions, and the player can also sell what he does not need.  
The main goal is to reach the final boss and defeat him.
Controls:  
- Q, W, E, R for skills and 1, 2, 3, 4 for potions on belt slots  
- C to open inventory, V to open talent tree  
- RMB - move, Shift - attack
